Pune, though it is not a cosmopolitan city like, Mumbai, is a pleasant getaway for those wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of urban life. The city has a very calm atmosphere with non-confronting people and is much more relaxed and peaceful than most other cities. It has a glorious history and was the early home of the great Marathi warrior, Shivaji. It became the Marathi capital in 1750. For a short period, it was under the control of the Nizam of Hyderabad and in 1817 it came under the British rule. Today, the city has lost much of its past grandeur of but the places around here are resonant with a rich heritage and natural beauty.
