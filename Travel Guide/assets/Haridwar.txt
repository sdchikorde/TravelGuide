Haridwar takes you beyond the superficial sophistry of politically correct modern day Hinduism and introduces you to a faith as simple as the curves of a lily in full bloom, as old as the heaven amidst the northern snows. This magnanimity makes Haridwar the Gateway to the Gods. Located at the base of the Shivalik hills of Uttar Pradesh, an feeling of divinity surrounds this sacred town. It is here that the Ganga is believed to wash away the sins of millions just by taking a dip in its holy waters. Folklore traces the origins of place to the great penance performed by King Shweta. Daksha Prajapati, Lord Shiva's father-in-law, also performed a yagna here. Again, it is here that the Devas (Gods) brought the pitcher of nectar to spoil the designs of the Rakshasas (Deamons). Besides its religious reverrence, Haridwar is a major adventure sports circuit and offers facilities for river rafting, tracking and mountaineering. It is also popular for its herbal remedies and Ayurveda (the ancient Indian science of medicine).
