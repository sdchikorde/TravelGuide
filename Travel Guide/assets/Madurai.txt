One of the oldest cities in South India, Madurai has been the centre of learning and pilgrimage for centuries. Archaeological evidences unearthed from this region suggest the existence of settlements in the Megalithic Age and the Neolithic Age. The ancient city had links with Greece and Rome and traded primarily in spices. Madurai also finds mention in many ancient texts. The Cholas took over the city in the 10th century AD. The Pandyas regained control in the 12th century AD, only to loose it again to the invaders under Malik Kafur. In 1364, the Vijayanagar kingdom was established with the overthrowing of the dynasty established by Malik Kafur. The Nayaks, who were the local governors of Madurai, took over the city after the fall of the Vijayanagar kingdom in 1565 and ruled it till 1781. The city was taken over by the British East India Company in 1801. Winters are the best season to visit the city.
