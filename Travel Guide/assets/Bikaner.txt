The city has high fortifications including a seven-kilometre long wall with five entrances encircling the city. The entire fortification was done in the 18th century. The city of Bikaner has had an eventful history. Its closeness to Delhi made it an easy target for the Mughal invasions time and again. As per legends, Rao Bhikaji sought the blessings of Goddess Karni at Deshnoke before embarking on his campaign. Karni Mata temple in Deshnoke thus became te deity of the ruling family. Today hundreds of pilgrims gather at the temple everyday to pray for the blessings of the Goddess, revered as an personification of Goddess Durga. Bikaner is also renowned for the having best riding camels in the world and is also the native land of the famous Bikaneri bhujia and namkeen (a salted snack made of lentils).
