With its stimulating ambience and undeniable aura of romance, Gwalior is one of the most impressive cities in India for the sensitive holidaymakers. According to legends, Suraj Sen, a prince of the Kachhwaha clan of the 8th century, lost his way while venturing in the jungle and reached an isolated hill wandering around. There he met a venerable old man, Sage Gwalipa. Thirsty and tired, he asked for some water and the sage led him to a pond. To his astonishment, the prince after drinking the water found that not only his thirst but his disease of leprosy has also been cured. He asked the sage if he could do anything in return and the sage told him to fortify the hill. The hill was fortified and named Gwalior, and the city that developed around it gradually acquired the name. The city was the stronghold of the Huns from Central Asia, the Kachhwaha Rajputs, the Pratihars, the Slave Dynasty of Delhi Sultanate, and the Tomars-of whom the most important king was Raja Man Singh (1486-1517). The Marathas under Madho Rao Scindia, the last dynasty to rule the city before Independence, restored Gwalior to its former glory. The imposing Jai Vilas Palace, situated below the hilltop Gwalior fort, is proof of the Scindia sway over the city.
