Pondicherry (or Puducheri) meaning 'the new settlement' used to be a French settlement comprising of Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam other than Pondicherry itself. A unique fact about Pondicherry is that it simultaneously spreads into several states. Karaikal is in Tamil Nadu while Mahe is in Kerala. Yanam on the other hand is a part of Andhra Pradesh. Today, Pondicherry is a union territory located approximately 2000 kms south of Chennai. However, its French connection is distinctly visible on the architecture and culture of the place. However, its fame lies in its relation with the saint-philosopher Aurobindo Ghosh, who founded his ashram here. Today, the ashram is home to nationals from different corners of the world, who come here in pursuit of peace and solitude. Unlike most other places in India, Pondicherry is a planned city. All the roads meet at right angles, adhering to the grid system and a long Petit Canal divides the city on the sea-ward side.
