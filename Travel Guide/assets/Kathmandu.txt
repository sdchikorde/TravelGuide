Kathmandu is a small city founded around AD 723 as Manju-Patan. In the days of the Malla Kingdom, it was known as Kantipur and was in the same rank as Patan and Bhaktpur. King Prithvi Narayan Shah was the man who made Kathmandu his capital in the 18th century and it never looked back after that. The opening of the country around 40 years back led to tremendous growth of tourism in the valley and the capital became a Mecca for trekkers, heaven for hippies, and a thriving cosmopolitan city.
