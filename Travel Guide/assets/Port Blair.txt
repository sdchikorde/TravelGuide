Port Blair which is about 1,200 km from Kolkata and Chennai is the capital of the 350- odd islands of Andaman and Nicobar. The breath-taking beaches and fascinating marine ecology on the reefs along with the scope for water sports, bird watching and fishing, make Port Blair one of the most enchanting tourist destinations in India. In 1789 Captain Archibald Blair belonging to the Navy of the East India Company, established a penal colony at this site and named it Port Cornwallis. The first European settlement was established here in 1858 near the site of this old penal colony. This colony was re-named Port Blair in honour of Captain Blair. The Andaman and Nicobar islands are home to some of the oldest tribes in the world. Though most of these tribes have modernized, some of them that still exist in the ‘primitive’ stage are hostile to any outside interference. The climate here is quite moderate with temperature ranging from 20-30ºC. South-west monsoons arrive here between the months of May and June and north-east monsoons between November and December.
