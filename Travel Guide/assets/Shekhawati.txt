Also refered to as the open art gallery of Rajasthan, Shekhawati is a priceless contribution of Marwari traders of Rajasthan. Shekhawati means 'the land of Shekha's clan' and was derived from Rao Shekha of Kachhwaha family of Jaipur in the 15th century. The region extends over the districts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar. Most of the havelis here were constructed between AD 1750 and 1930 by the Marwaris, but a long period of droughts forced many families to leave. The architectural style of the havelis or mansions here majorly focuses on enclosing the courtyard. Most of the havelis are painted in colours like indigo, yellow, green, maroon and blue with beautiful wall paintings adorning the walls.
