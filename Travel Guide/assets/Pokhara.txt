The biggest tourist destination in Nepal after its capital, Kathmandu, is the city of Pokhara. It is a beautiful sub-tropical valley bounded by lofty Himalayan peaks. The name Pokhara has been derived from the word pokhri which means pond in Nepali. In earlier times, the place was nothing more than a big lake. Presently, in addition to the town, there are three big lakes namely, Phewa, Rupa and Begnas. Due to its proximity to the Himalayan peaks, Pokhara is home to some beautiful vistas. The sudden changes in the altitude make the place even more charming. Pokhara does not have a particularly long history. It was founded in the 16th century by the Gurungs. Today, Pokhara is the centre of a well-established river rafting industry and the starting point of many exciting treks. It is also an important administrative and commercial centre in Nepal. The landscape of Pokhran has changed a lot over the last few decades and a lot of natural space has been used up to build houses and places of accommodation for the ever-increasing number of visitors. But Pokhara has still managed to maintain its small town image which is best manifested during the off season.
