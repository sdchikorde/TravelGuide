Few places in the world are endowed with such rich cultural traditions as in this romantic city of Nawabs.. In 1732, Muhammad Shah, one of the later kings of the once-powerful Mughal dynasty, appointed Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan, a Persian adventurer of noble lineage, to the viceroyalty of the area known as Avadh, of which Lucknow was a part. Saadat Khan was the founder of the famous dynasty known as the Nawab Wazirs - a dynasty which changed the face of this little-known place. The rapid growth of Lucknow dates from 1755 when the fourth Nawab, Asaf-ud-Daula transferred the capital of Avadh from Faizabad to Lucknow and began constructing some splendid architectural marvels. During this period, Lucknow also established its pre-eminent place in the field of poetry, music and dance. In fact, even today the city breathes history, and the sound of laughter and music, the tinkling of ankle bells and the mellifluous rendering of Urdu poetry (shairi) still echo through the long corridors of time.
