Dehradun is the capital city of the newly formed Himalayan state of Uttaranchal. Situated, 235 km from Delhi, it lies at the very center of the Doon valley. The city has the Shivalik range to its south, the Himalayas to its north, the Yamuna to its west and the sacred Ganges to its east. Dehradun is in the Garhwal Himalayan region, earlier known as Kedar Khand. Initially, Katyuris of Garhwal ruled this region. Later, it passed into the control of the Sikhs and Mughals. The Gorkhas of Nepal also ruled here before the British came into the picture. After the Treaty of Sugauli between the Gorkhas and the British, signed in 1816, the British established their grasp on the entire Garhwal and Kumaon regions. Though the enchanting city displays the old-fashioned flavours of the Raj, tourism has turned it into a metropolitan.
