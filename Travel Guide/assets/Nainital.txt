This charming hill station of Uttaranchal (former Uttar Pradesh), situated at an altitude of 1,938 metres, has many villas, bungalows, and a number of other sites of tourist importance. It is said that the name of the place has been derived from the Naini Lake that lies just in the middle of the town.., it was in 1841 when an Englishman named Barron chanced upon the lake. Fascinated by the scenic beauty of the lake and thickly forested hills, he constructed a house here. By 1858, Nainital became a well-known hill station, and within a few years it became the summer seat of the provincial government. The climate of Nainital is cool and pleasant. The best season to visit this place is during summer between March and June.
