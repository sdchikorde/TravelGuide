Renowned for its Nataraja Temple, the municipal town of Chidambaram is located 235 kms off Chennai on the National highway connect Chennai and Thanjavur.. Chidambaram attracts thousands of Shaivite and Vaishnavite pilgrims to sacred Nataraja temple every year. As per legends, two famous saints of South India, Patanjali and Vyagrapada worshipped Lord Shiva here. Their collective reparation was rewarded by Shiva's cosmic dance, which was exposed to them on the auspicious Thai Poosam day. Lord Shiva descended as Nataraja - the King of Dancer - to perform the ananda tandavam (cosmic dance). The place became a sacred ground. Around this hallowed site a city called Chit Ambaram (wisdom - suffused sky) developed over time. In AD 907, Chidambaram became the capital of the Chola Empire. They commissioned the construction of the grand Nataraja temple, later enlarged and embellished by them.
