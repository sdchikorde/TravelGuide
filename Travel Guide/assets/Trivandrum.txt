Thiruvananthapuram (formerly, Trivandrum), the capital of the Indian state of Kerala, lies on the southwest coast of India. The place is well connected to most of the other major cities of India through rail, road, and air network. The city derives its name from Thiru Anantha Puram, which means the town of Anantha. In fact, Anantha is the deity at the Sree Anantha Padmanabhaswami Temple, a major landmark of the city believed to be several thousands years old. Legend has it that traders came to Thiruvananthapuram as far back as AD 190 for spices, sandalwood, and ivory. It was in the 18th century that Thiruvananthapuram shot into prominence when the erstwhile kings of the then Travancore state shifted their capital from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram. After India's independence, the city was made the capital of Kerala. The city's proximity to the sea gives it a pleasant climate throughout the year though the summers can turn a bit hot with the maximum temperature at times going up to 36.2'C. The monsoon here lasts from May to November.
