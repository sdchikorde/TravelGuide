Each year before the arrival of winter, thousands of birds migrate from the frozen waters of Siberia, Tibet, Mongolia and eastern Europe to India. One of the best destinations for these birds is the marsh of Bharatpur lying between Agra and Jaipur in the north-western part of India. The protected area of about 29 square kms is now the famous Keoladeo Ghana National Park. The reserve derives its name (Keoladeo) from a temple devoted to Lord Shiva which is situated in the park. The reserve was established in 1890 by the Maharaja of Bharatpur is purely for the creation of an exclusive royal game. A large area of the forests is enclosed with earthen embankments called bunds. These bund led to the creation numerous lakes and marshes. Large-scale conservation efforts initiated by famous ornithologist Dr. Salim Ali led to the reserve being declared as a National Park in March 1982. In 1985 the sanctuary was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
