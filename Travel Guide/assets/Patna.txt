Patna is the capital of the state of Bihar and is situated on the southern bank of the holy river, Ganges. The dusty and crowded city of Patna, as we see it today, was once upon a time, the most esteemed seats of power and learning in ancient India, being the capital of the mighty Magadh and Mauryan empires. Even today, there exist many interesting monuments here that remind one of the rich past of this city. The history of the city dates back to 2,500 years ago when it was founded on the confluence of the rivers Ganga, Sone, Punpun and Gandak by the Magadhan king, Ajatshatru, who named it Pataligram. Later, the city was given names such as Kusumpur, Pataliputra, and finally Patna. The glory of Patna started with the Mauryan emperor, Chandragupta who made Pataliputra the capital of his empire, extending from the Gangetic plains to the area which is Afghanistan today. The city reached the zenith of its glory during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, a follower of Buddhism and one of the great kings of India. The city was the centre of power till the end of the Gupta period, after which it started languishing continuously, for a long period. It was revived with the coming of Sher Shah to the seat of Delhi after which the city became the capital of the Bengal province. In the initial days of the East India Company, Patna served as the main warehouse for the hugely profitable opium business with China. Much of its erstwhile glory no longer remains today, yet recent excavations at Kumhrar have unearthed some interesting structures. Patna is also the main gateway to famous Buddhist sites like Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Rajgir and Vaishali.
