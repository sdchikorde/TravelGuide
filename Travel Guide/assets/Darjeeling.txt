For the sheer splendor of mountains, unsullied and pristine, nothing comes close to the celebrated hill station of Darjeeling in West Bengal. As you drive up the curvaceous roads or board the famous toy train, you will be fascinated by the resplendence of nature. From the damp plains, your tired lungs get filled with fresh mountain air. Gurgling streams emerge from the crack in the rocks and in springtime, the ranges are decorated with rhododendrons. The ethnic population is gracious and the influence of Buddhism is strong. Past the Batasia loop, the Ghoom Buddhist monastery, and the lush tea gardens, lies the quaint town peeping at you from behind high pines. Darjeeling rose into eminence during the British Raj as a rest and recreation centre. Till the 19th century, Darjeeling (originally Dorje Ling, or place of the thunderbolt) was under Sikkim. In 1817, Sikkim passed the rights to use it as a health clinic to the British in return for their help in settling a rather devastating dispute between Sikkim and Nepal. The mark of the colonial legacy can be seen in its tea estates, gardens, hotels and lifestyle.
