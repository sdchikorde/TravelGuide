Bhopal lies on the banks of a enormous lake spanning several square miles, dominating its landscape and giving it a magnetic, mesmerizing quality. The serenity of the lake is perhaps is responsible for an air of almost deliberate lethargy and gratification. Bhopal once a small, sleepy picturesque town with lush forests and laid-back days of shikars, picnics and quiet fishing trips is the capital of the state of Madhya Pradesh. But still, in the wake industrialization and growth resulting in conflux of people, Bhopal retains its eternal quaintness and charm. Situated along the slopes of a sandstone ridge in the north-western part of Madhya Pradesh, the city was built by King Bhoj in the 11th century. The region was a part of the Mughal Empire till 1707. The Begums of the royal family ruled it for almost a hundred years, before Nawab Hamidullah, son of Nawab Sultan Jahan, the third Begum, ascended the throne in 1926. He acceded Bhopal to India in 1947.
