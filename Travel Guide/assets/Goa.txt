Beautiful views of golden sand on the beaches, blue waters of the sea, the sylvan forests, Palm-swathed hills, islands, and riverine waters are some of visual wonder which Goa generously and continuously keeps unfolding. Add to this the tang of fish-curry rice, the pleasure of discovering a crab under a stone, the moistened sips of cocum, and walking on a beach full of crisp seashells. This is where the mind stops thinking and the heart begins to talk! In monsoon this hundred-kilometre coastline becomes a fantasyland. On one side stands the palm trees swaying in the wind, and on the other is the vast Indian Ocean greeting you. This and much more is the attraction of Goa. Situated on the western coast of India, Goa is split into North Goa with Panaji the capital city and South Goa with Vasco da Gama and Margao in it. Historically, a part of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BC, it has been under the influence of Satavahanas, Adil Shahi Dynasty of Bijapur, Chalukyans, Vijaynagar, and finally under Alfonso de Albuquerque the Portuguese who invaded Goa in 1510. They ruled till 1961, when the Indian forces liberated it amd made it a part of the Republic of India.
